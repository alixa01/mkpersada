  description:
    "Artificial lift is a production enhancement method used to reduce bottomhole pressure (BHP) and increase fluid flow from the well. It can be achieved using positive-displacement pumps such as beam pumps or Progressive Cavity Pumps (PCP), centrifugal pumps like Electric Submersible Pumps (ESP), or gas lift systems that reduce fluid density in the tubing. Artificial lift helps initiate flow in non-flowing wells and boosts production in active wells, making it essential for most oil wells and highly beneficial for gas wells to maintain efficient and stable output.",

    "The term production logging covers a wide array of sensors, measurements and interpretation techniques. Operators use production logs to evaluate fluid movement in and out of wellbores, quantify flow rates and determine fluid properties at downhole conditions. Completion engineers can evaluate production and perforation efficiency and plan remediation or modify future completion designs based on the interpretation of production logs. Reservoir and production engineers can use these logs to help manage and optimize well and reservoir performance. Number of logging tools are available to provide information during production operations and beyond.",
